- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as a static site generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes to speed up styling
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to easly build reusable components with those classes
- [Twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/gatsby-styled-components) to make those three from above work together without pain
- [Formium](https://formium.io/) to create forms nice and easy and to manage responses
